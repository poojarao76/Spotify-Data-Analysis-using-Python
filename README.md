# Spotify-Data-Analysis-using-Python

This project entails an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization of Spotify's music data using Python. As part of my journey into Data Science, I delved into the vast realm of Spotify's music database to uncover insights and patterns.

## About the Project

This project explores and quantifies data about music from Spotify, a Swedish audio streaming and media services provider founded in April 2006. With over 381 million monthly active users, including 172 million paid subscribers, Spotify is the world's largest music streaming service provider.

## Project Highlights

* Conducted comprehensive data cleaning to ensure data integrity and reliability.
  
* Employed Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
  
* Explored relationships between various audio features of songs and their corresponding sentiment using sentiment analysis techniques.
  
* Derived actionable insights from the analysis to understand music trends and user preferences on Spotify.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** Main programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
  
* **Pandas:** Powerful data manipulation and analysis library in Python.
  
* **NumPy:** Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
  
* **Matplotlib:** Comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
  
* **Seaborn:** Data visualization library based on matplotlib for making attractive and informative statistical graphics.
